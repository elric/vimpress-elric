*vimpress-elric"
===============

This is only the vimpress script I made from bits and pieces of the
already existing ones. So far, this one contains all features
available through the other.

Install:
========
Copy the files to ~/.vim in each folder.
Edit blog.vim with your username and password (see 
instructions).
Run :helptags ~/.vim/doc.
